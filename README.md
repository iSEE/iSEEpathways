The goal of `iSEEpathways` is to provide panels to facilitate the
interactive visualisation of pathway analysis results in
*[iSEE](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/iSEE)* applications.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `iSEEpathways` from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("iSEEpathways")
```

And the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/iSEE/iSEEpathways) with:

``` r
BiocManager::install("iSEE/iSEEpathways")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to load the package:

``` r
library("iSEEpathways")
## basic example code
```
